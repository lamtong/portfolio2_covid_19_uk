# Time Series Forecasting Using the ARIMA Model for COVID-19 Cases

*Tools Used: Python (Jupiter Notebook)*

## Introduction
This report presents an analysis of the daily COVID-19 cases in the UK from January 1, 2020, to June 14, 2020. The objective of this study is to model and forecast the number of cases for the next seven days (June 15-21, 2020) using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The study evaluates stationarity, selects appropriate model parameters, estimates the model, and assesses the accuracy of the forecast.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
The dataset includes daily reported COVID-19 cases from January 1, 2020, to June 14, 2020. The last seven days were set aside for forecasting purposes.

### Stationarity Assessment
To determine whether the time series is stationary, the following steps were taken:
- **Visual Inspection**: A plot of the time series was examined to identify trends and seasonality.
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: The autocorrelation function (ACF) was used to assess whether past values influence future values.
- **Differencing Requirement**: If the time series exhibited a trend, differencing was applied to transform it into a stationary series.

### ARIMA Model Selection
- The order of differencing (d) was determined based on stationarity tests.
- The AutoRegressive (p) and Moving Average (q) terms were identified using ACF and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots.
- Various ARIMA models were tested to select the most suitable one based on model fit statistics (AIC, BIC, RMSE).

### Model Estimation
- The selected ARIMA model was estimated by fitting it to the dataset.
- The significance of the parameters was evaluated to ensure model adequacy.
- Model residuals were analyzed to check for randomness and absence of autocorrelation.

### Forecasting and Model Evaluation
- The estimated ARIMA model was used to forecast COVID-19 cases for June 15-21, 2020.
- Forecast accuracy was assessed by comparing predicted values with actual values.
- A more parsimonious model was explored to determine if a simpler model could achieve comparable predictive performance.

## Results and Interpretation
### Stationarity Assessment
The initial time series plot indicated a non-stationary process due to an increasing trend. The ACF plot showed high positive correlations at multiple lags, suggesting a need for differencing. First-order differencing was applied, after which the series became stationary, as confirmed by a flattening in the ACF plot.

### ARIMA Model Selection and Estimation
Based on ACF and PACF analysis, different ARIMA models were tested. The optimal model was identified based on performance metrics and diagnostic checks. The final model effectively captured both the trend and autocorrelation structure in the data.

### Forecasting Results
The selected ARIMA model was used to predict daily COVID-19 cases for June 15-21, 2020. The predictions followed the observed pattern of fluctuations. The accuracy of the forecast was evaluated using error metrics, and the results indicated reasonable prediction performance.

### Model Parsimony
An alternative, more parsimonious model was considered. By reducing the number of parameters while maintaining predictive accuracy, a simpler ARIMA model was proposed that effectively described the data.

## Conclusion
This study demonstrates the application of ARIMA modeling for time series forecasting of COVID-19 cases. The selected model successfully captured the trend and provided reliable short-term forecasts. The analysis highlights the importance of stationarity, parameter selection, and model evaluation in time series forecasting, offering valuable insights for public health monitoring and decision-making.
